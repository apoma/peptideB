RELEASE_NOTES :
===============

 * Oct 01, 2009:
     - Hamiltonian replica exchange has now been implemented. Example file in
       examples/polyala.tcl.

 * Sep 22, 2009:
     - STRIDE has been added to packages/.
	 - RAGTIME can now take into account Periodic Boundary Conditions when
       computing hydrogen bonds.

 * Sep 10, 2009:
     - added packages/ folder containing both Ragtime and Native_contacts.
	 - deleted scripts/ folder
	 - moved configs/ folder to examples/.

 * Sep 09, 2009:
	 - myconfig.h added.
	 - environment variables (e.g. PEPTIDEB_DIR) more natually used in
	   peptidebuilder.tcl and .espressorc

 * Jul 09, 2009:
 	 - No more 'espresso_switch' variable. Replaced by 'espresso'.
	 - Started implementing '-randequilib' -- choose random dihedrals
	   according to an equilibrated structure (ramachandran maps).
 
 * Jun 15, 2009:
     - Measurement of observables improved.

 * May  5, 2009:
     - Hydrophobic environment support. Still need to tune parameters.
 
 * Mar 10, 2009:
     - Automatically stop the simulation once any order parameter has reached
	   a certain threshold.
     - Use David Stone's script qparammod.sh to calculate native interactions
	   in a peptide, by using the command line argument CONTACT{1,2} (one can
	   define two independent contact order parameters).

 * Nov  6, 2008:
     - peptideB is now coupled to the ragtime.tcl script. When invoking the
	   argument -ragtime L where L is a 1-letter code (either A for
	   alpha-helix or B for beta-sheet) that will store the ratio of selected
	   conformation as a function of time. 

 * Oct  7, 2008:
	 - Electrostatics has been implemented using Debye-Hueckel potentials.
	   A second version of the MJ coefficients have been implemented for that
	   purpose. 
	 - Parameter optimization has been removed.
	 - Somehow there are still problems with display of proteins which are
	   stretched between two edges of the box...

 * Jul 22, 2008:
     - Fixed some problems related to confinement of proteins in the
       simulation box. They had the tendency to escape ! This seems to be
       solved now, but it's not sure...
     - The force field is now fixed. It gives very promising results with
       folding events of helix bundles and early aggregation events of small
       peptides. 

 * Jun 26, 2008:
     - Proline has a specific N bead which doesn't Hbond.

 * Jun 10, 2008:
     - Starting an implementation of the replica exchange algorithm. It will
       only allow as many simulations as processors.
     - Analysis of the potential energy.

 * May 29, 2008:
     - The program is now able to resume a simulation. This does not seem to
       work all the time... I should look at it again.

 * May 27, 2008:
     - [CHANGE] Side chains are now more coarse-grained, less specificity in
       their positions and van der Waals radii. The weird dihedral potentials
       have been removed.
     - Improper dihedral angle now depends on chirality.

 * May 14, 2008:
     - [NEW] order parameter Q which measures the distance between C_alpha
       atoms. This should yield much better results than dihedrals. This can
       be turned on by adding '-native FILE' as an argument.
     - [NEW] Source parameters in the force field from the configuration file. 

 * May 13, 2008:
     - Brand new force field parameters based on Ramachandran plot
       analysis. Van der Waals, temperature, hydrogen bonds, seem to be finely
       tuned. 
     - New pdb startup file. Side chain beads are now explicitely rendered, as
       well as their hydrophobicity using a color-code (Blue/Red). There's now
       two startup files created, one for displaying the backbone using the
       licorice representation and one displaying the structure using
       NewCartoon. 

 * May  8, 2008:
     - The parameter optimizer has a new filename, which doesn't include the
       year anymore. The overhead now includes the names of the parameters
       that are being optimized.
     - Implementing specificity on the side chains. They will now have
       different strength, position relative to the backbone, and van der
       waals radii. The strengths of all the amino acids is controlled by a
       single parameter, since we use a hydrophobicity scale to weight the
       different attractions between sidechains. Note that even if the code
       might refer to beta-carbons, they are all replaced by the center of
       mass of the side chain.

 * May  7, 2008:
     - [CHANGE] Namespace nesting has been redesigned. All functions and
       variables now belong to the peptideb namespace. This will be useful once
       I combine this script with an upcoming lipid model.

 * May  6, 2008:
     - [NEW] Output file for parameter optimization. It saves the state in a
       file simplex.dat in the current directory. The file has an identifier
       that depends on the date.
     - [CHANGE] peptidebuilder will not print integration steps when doing
       parameter optimization anymore.

 * May  5, 2008:
     - [NEW] Implementation of the nearest-neighbor dipole interaction by
       applying a bias in the dihedral potentials of the angles phi and psi. 

 * May  2, 2008: 
     - [NEW] Implementation of the parameter optimizer.
     - The hbond potential was capped in order not to misbehave in very rare
       configurations. The capping can be set in src/chain_interactions.tcl
       using the ::HBond_max_cap variable. It looks like 100.0 is a good
       number for now.
